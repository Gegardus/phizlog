<!-- 
View uses object variable supplied to this rendered view to display the amount of likes the particular object has.
A link is created using the comment_likes_path route which is passed the object as a parameter. 
This nested route links to the create method in the Likes controller.

<!-- 
the â€˜method: :postâ€™ parameter on the link_to method is necessary to create a new Like object. 
But generally link_to is used to GET information.
